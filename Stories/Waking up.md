I woke up with a start.
I looked around, my senses taking in my surroundings. Where was I? A underground lab of some sort, it seemed. 
I got out of the capsule which I was in and spun around to take a better look at the place. Bottles spilled, fumes in the air. Vines hung from the cavern above, cobwebs decorating the dusty walls.
Chairs were toppled over, and some buttons were still lit up. A tension hung in the air, despite no figure appearing under my sight. 
I continued pacing around, gazing at the scene before me, gingerly taking each step. 
And then, my eyes fell upon a note.
A small, crumpled up, yellow-tinged note.
I picked it up, slowly unraveling its secrets.

"Test subject 1207: Uncontrollable, shows signs of aggresion." 

I read the words, unsure of what it meant.
But a sudden realization hit me.

My heart skipped a beat.

I turned back and took a closer look at the capsule which I had emerged from.
Across the cracked glass, 4 numbers hastily scribbled on spoke,

"1207".

I am the monster.
